        <h1>History of the Project</h1>
        <p>
            The idea for this project was born out of the need to easily compare and analyze laptop specifications from a large dataset.
            Many consumers struggle to understand technical jargon or to find laptops that meet their specific needs.

            This website was created as a data-driven solution, where users can:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Explore a wide range of laptops from different brands</li>
            <li>Understand configurations through structured data</li>
            <li>Make informed purchase decisions based on specs and ratings</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It started as a simple CSV data exploration exercise and evolved into a full web application using Flask, Pandas, and HTML templates.
            The goal is to combine learning with utility—demonstrating how raw data can be transformed into an interactive, user-friendly experience.
